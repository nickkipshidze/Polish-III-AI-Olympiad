    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern photographs often contain multiple objects and complex scenes. The photograph above is an example: we see a man in a jacket, shirt, and tie, a woman in a dress with a veil, a group of people in summer clothes, and the whole scene takes place on a beach, against a backdrop of water and a sunset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to stick to the classic \"one image—one label\" approach, we would have to choose just one category: does this photo represent a wedding, a man, a woman, a jacket, a dress, a beach...? In practice, this means an artificial limitation of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we don't have to limit ourselves to a single label. This is precisely why multi-label classification is used, as it allows assigning multiple categories describing various objects to a single image.\n",
    "Instead of choosing one label, we can therefore say:\n",
    "\"This image contains instances of the classes: person, jacket, shirt, tie, dress, beach, etc.\""

    "Your task is to define and train a neural network to perform multi-label classification. In this task, the composition of the photo will be simplified compared to the example above. Only clothes will be visible in the photos, and your task is to create a model that can determine whether a given type of clothing is present in the picture.\n",

    "Each sample is an image with dimensions of $168 \\times 168$ pixels. Associated with each image is a 10-element vector with values of $0$ and $1$, which determines the presence of a given class in the image. Information about which piece of clothing corresponds to each index in the label vector is provided in the `LABEL_NAMES` dictionary defined in one of the code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criterion\n",
    "The final evaluation of the task will be based on the average value of the $F1$ measure calculated using the *macro* scheme.\n",
